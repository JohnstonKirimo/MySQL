/*
Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.
Return the result table in any order.
The query result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input:
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
*/

select distinct a.num as ConsecutiveNums
from logs a
inner join logs b
on a.id + 1 = b.id and a.num = b.num
inner join logs c
on a.id + 2 = c.id and a.num = c.num;
